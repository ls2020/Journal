I was reading through some of the students' blog posts in our class yesterday and I thought it was cool to see how so many of us grew as a result of being in this course, especially since we have had to transition to an online learning format... It does seem that this class is quite fitting in consideration of the circumstances... Part of me though is a bit scared for our final project because I am not always a fan of working in groups, but hopefully it will turn out okay
