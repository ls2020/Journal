While I was reading the Walden reading yesterday and was trying to find a passage that I could link to what are now uncomfortable circumstances given the pandemic, I thought about isolation. Throughout so much of this text, we see a man who is alone in the world, with the exception of his ventures into town where he can catch up on the latest gossip. I began to think of how it feels to be home, and how as much as I would like to see all of my home friends, that it is not possible given the current situation outside. It makes me feel isolated too, but I guess what is more comforting is that my friends are doing the same as I am. 

Even in The Info reading we have this week there are discussions about Wikipedia and how it is distrusted by many people since it usually is not a valid source of information. I thought about today's world and how quickly accurate or inaccurate info is spread so quickly among people either by word of mouth, social media, or other outlets. In many ways, this book applies to life today and the way in which many of us, if not all of us, connect on a daily basis.
