I came into the English minor having known that I appreciated grammar usage, and that I also loved writing articles for the newspaper. I have been writing for my school’s newspaper and have pretty much always been involved in some way since eighth grade. I just feel that my writing flows better when I write articles, I do not have to think as much about what I write. 

On the other hand, I strongly dislike writing poems, essays, and any other sort of creative writing type because I do not have that crafty mindset, and quite frankly, they are so irritating to write. Each of these requires so much time and skill, both of which I do not have. 

Of the various English courses I have taken thus far at Geneseo, there have only been two where I felt that “aha!” moment close to the end of the semester. The first time I experienced this exhilirating moment was last semester in Dr. McCoy’s English 203 class. She pushed me to be the greatest version of myself, both as a writer and as a person, and made the learning process exciting. In our class, we had blog posts to write. I would find connections between the literature and class discussions, eagerly go to her office hours, and have her tell me to “slow down” and just write. I came out of that course having felt as if I had been more developed as a writer, and also that I chose the right minor. 

This semester, I enrolled in English 340, my first ever 300 level class. This class filled an elective course. I was definitely not the most technologically-savvy person at all. My few skills included opening up a new tab or using the search bar. If anyone were to ask me to code a file, I would stare at them dumbfounded. I was undeniably at a beginners level. 

While I previously associated English with the most crafty and bothersome work, such as essays and poems, this class made me realize just how digital English could be. Learning more about this discipline on a more digital platform made me realize how imperfect both people and writing are. 

As I completed a recent Walden assignment where each of us had to compare different versions of Henry David Thoreau’s edits, I realized the imperfections of writing. Thoreau went through several revisions for Walden, always willing to make the necessary changes. Some of his sentences and word choices changed; however, the beauty is that his intended meaning was preserved despite how imperfect his writing was at times. 

As for myself in this course, I felt like a lost puppy for several weeks. I was confused quite frequently and at times recognized that I had no idea what I was doing. I raised my hand in class all the time. Github made no sense to me. The major reason behind this is because a few weeks ago, pre-COVID-19, I still did not know how to upload a journal file to my repository. I had not taken the time to really understand the necessary steps to do so, which on my end is a mistake and generally caused me to feel more anxious. 

I was still trying to understand Visual Studio code. I would somehow open what felt like 80 new journal files at once, all accidentally. I was just copying down the functions I saw on the projector screen in class, not actually understanding anything I was typing into my file. I also felt uncomfortable using Terminal, just because of all the strange commands. There were far more digital elements to this course than I expected, as funny as that sounds (given that it is a digital class for English). 

Some of my thoughts over the course of the semester: How do I upload a journal file to Github? Am I dumb or dumb? Why is using Visual Studio Code so challenging for me? Am I doing something wrong? Am I in the right minor?
 
Admittedly, my skills were as imperfect as could be. While learning in and out of class, I was trying to make revisions in my own life as a writer and student to progress my own English skills. 

I made a strange observation, though. While this pandemic has been awful, being more independent as both a student and writer has allowed me to work on my imperfections, just like Thoreau worked on his. I no longer need help on a weekly basis with uploading journals to Github (partly because I asked for a step-by-step tutorial). I no longer need immediate assistance with using other cool websites like TimelineJS. 

Even with TimelineJS, I had never heard or seen such a thing. I was so intimidated when we had to open this website for the first time recently; it seemed so out of my comfort zone and I immediately felt like I needed to write in Slack for help. But, when I looked at the TimelineJS example and when I also looked at other students’ examples from the class, I realized it was far more simple that it appeared. I knew then and there that I needed to trust myself more and be more confident in my abilities. The only way to tailor imperfections is by working on them. 

Had I not been in this class, I would have never learned about half of the websites we used in class; I would have never used a Terminal application; I honestly would have never heard of any of the things we did. 


Reflecting on my growth as a student, I feel extremely accomplished. This course made me realize that English, even in its digital world, requires diligence and skills. I also realized that no writer is perfect, and there are always modifications to make whether it be in terms of honing writing skills, or rewording. I need to keep practicing for myself so that I can feel more confident in my own abilities. After all, Thoreau did not create one version of his manuscript and call it quits. I do not look at Github anymore and immediately feel like a failure and close the tab. I do not look at the TimelineJS website and feel unconfident in my abilities and seek immediate help. All of this growth is because I took the time to hone my skills, and I am still making progress too. I am not nearly close to perfect, and neither are my skills as an English student. But I am proud of myself for developing a closer connection between myself and this discipline.
