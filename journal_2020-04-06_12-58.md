For today's timeline assignment I chose to write about how computers have transformed technology... I used four examples, such as earlier written languages and new machines. It was honestly really interesting to see just how much the world has transformed as a result of the development of new communicative mechanisms. It is even more fascinating to know that people decades ago were able to engineer machinery such as computers, that are so widely used today.
