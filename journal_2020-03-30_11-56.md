I honestly felt unsure of what to write for this journal, but decided that maybe that's the best way to go: undecided. I will allow myself to ramble instead, being that I have various thoughts circulating through my mind right now. The whole world is currently in a state of fear. There is so much misinformation circulating right now about the virus. I miss normalcy. I miss my friends. I just want all of this to be over already. On a brighter  note, this pandemic makes me feel even more grateful for my own health and for my incredible support system. Aside from the virus, I cannot entirely describe how it is that I feel about distant learning. I don't have a choice in it, of course, but I would much rather be on campus. It is slightly more complicated to follow with different curriculums and to stay on top of workloads. I just feel in need of slightly more direction.
