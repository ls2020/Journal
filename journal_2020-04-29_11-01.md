One tool our class has used a lot is Slack in order to communciate with our English class... While I had to remind myself to check it for any announcements, now, looking at the website has become part of my every day routine. It is definitely an easy mechanism to use to speak to others and to ask for help. Aside from Slack, the other day I was completing the assignment we had and asked Professor Schacht for help since I was unsure of what to do. It was cool to see the format of texts in VS Code. He definitely helped me better understand coding and its importance.
