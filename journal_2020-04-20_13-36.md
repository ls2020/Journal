I basically finished my blog post and am now waiting for someone to read it over for me ... As I just completed the discussion assignment due Wednesday, I realized that I have actually learned a lot from being in this class and I'm overall, really proud of my progress. I definitely do feel more tech-savvy, which is a cool feeling ... I am somewhat nervous though for this final project assignment.
