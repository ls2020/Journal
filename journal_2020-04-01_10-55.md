I'm trying to brainstorm ideas for the next blog post... I'm considering how much I've grown as a writer? Have I become more comfortable writing in a more conversational way? Or have I found it difficult to adapt? Am I tech savvy? Am I in the right minor? These are questions I think about... I think I'm doing the right thing and I think my technological capabilities have grown from being in this class. I feel more connected to what I am doing, especially since I have a greater sense of what I'm doing now - such as pushing to github
